# Employee Database Tracker

## Description

The goal of this project was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Usage

After entering node index into the command terminal the user will be able to choose a prompt from a list depending on what action they would like to take, such as view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role!
